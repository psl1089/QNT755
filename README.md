Cluster analysis of COVID-19 mortality rates based on vaccinations per 100 and booster rates per 100.  Two data sources were used, both from the WHO as they both 
contained useful information.  Only nations that appeared in both files were considered.

Nations were divided into three clusters, and a cursory examination of the results shows that higher vaccination and booster rates are clearly associated with 
lower mortality rates.
